MultipleHeaderRecyclerView
==============================
Just a way to manage multiple sections with different heads and different ViewHolder inside the same RecyclerView

What is it?
-------------
__MultiheaderSectionRecyclerView__ is a library for allowing you to create a RecyclerView with differents kind of sections (ViewHolders) and it's own titles in an easy way. As you can see in the example below, we have a RecyclerView with three differents kind of sections (Event, Comic and Character) and it's own titles:

Why?
------
Because I would like to provide an easy way to create one of this elements __without need to override__ the same methods again. I've created this __generic module__ which we could use in differents projects.

How?
